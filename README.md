# intro-to-microservices

We continue with the successful train of S-Labs events and
for May we are planning to talk about microservices.
Our hosts Catapano Tonino, Pizzo Francesco and Seyvecou Justin will talk about:
- what is a microservice
- when/why/how to use microservices
- how to refactor big monoliths to microservices effectively
- more..
and of course we are going to write our very own microservices!

We will work with 3 different languages (Java, Node, Python) and
hack our way to write simple, fast and resilient microservices examples
in a heterogenic language scenario.


## Knowledge requisites:
- REST, HTTP protocol, basic O.O.
